                I just wanna die! Stealing stuff is about the stuff, not the stealing. What, cover me in gasoline and
                spiders? Fine, yeah, I'm in. You don't know me!
                It’s a new machine. It detects stuff all the way up your butt. Yeah, those two were fucking. You're
                growing up fast, Morty. You're going into a great big thorn straight into my ass. I dunno, some people
                would pay top dollar for that kind of breakthrough.
                I'm your worst nightmare, bitch! Looossseeerrrrr. It's a figure of speech, Morty! They're bureaucrats! I
                don't respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty! You have no idea what prison is like here! Well, she's my
                daughter, Summer. I outrank you. Or, family means nothing, in which case, don't play that card.
